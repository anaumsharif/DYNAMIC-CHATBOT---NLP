## DYNAMIC-CHATBOT-NLP using Wikipedia Summary

The **DYNAMIC-CHATBOT-NLP** project is a dynamic chatbot that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide intelligent responses based on Wikipedia summaries. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, usage instructions, and examples.
The DYNAMIC-CHATBOT-NLP project is a dynamic chatbot powered by natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically designed to provide intelligent responses based on real-time Wikipedia summaries. This project combines NLP capabilities with information retrieval from Wikipedia to create an interactive and educational chatbot experience.

Project Objectives
The primary objective of the DYNAMIC-CHATBOT-NLP project is to offer a versatile and responsive chatbot that can provide insightful information on a wide range of topics sourced from Wikipedia. Key goals of this project include:

Real-time Information Retrieval:
Fetching up-to-date and accurate information from Wikipedia based on user queries.
Natural Language Understanding:
Processing user inputs using NLP techniques to extract key topics and formulate meaningful responses.
### Project Overview

The **DYNAMIC-CHATBOT-NLP** chatbot is designed to dynamically fetch and summarize information from Wikipedia based on user queries. By leveraging NLP libraries and Wikipedia APIs, this chatbot can provide insightful responses to a wide range of topics covered on Wikipedia.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **Dynamic Information Retrieval**:
  - Fetches Wikipedia summaries in real-time based on user queries to provide up-to-date and relevant information.

- **Natural Language Understanding**:
  - Utilizes NLP techniques to process user inputs, extract key information, and formulate appropriate responses.

- **Interactive Chat Interface**:
  - Engages users in a conversational manner, responding to questions and providing detailed explanations sourced from Wikipedia.

### Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip`):
  - `wikipedia-api` for interacting with Wikipedia
  - `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) for NLP operations

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install wikipedia-api nltk
```

You'll also need to download the NLTK data by running the following commands:

```bash
python -m nltk.downloader punkt
python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
```

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaumsharif/DYNAMIC-CHATOT---NLP.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd dynamic-chatbot-nlp
   ```

3. **Run the Chatbot**:

   Execute the `chatbot.py` script to start the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

4. **Interact with the Chatbot**:

   Once the chatbot is running, type your questions or topics of interest. The chatbot will fetch Wikipedia summaries and provide responses based on the input.

### Project Structure

- **`chatbot.py`**:
  - Main script that implements the chatbot functionality.
  - Handles user interactions, processes queries, and retrieves Wikipedia summaries.

### Examples

Interact with the chatbot by asking questions or entering topics of interest:

```
User: What is artificial intelligence?
Chatbot: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

User: Tell me about Albert Einstein.
Chatbot: Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics.
```
